3-finger flick up or down            | Scroll one page at a time
3-finger flick right or left         | Go to the next or previous page (e.g. Home screen)
4-finger tap at top of screen        | Select first item on screen
4-finger tap at bottom of screen     | Select last item on screen
2-finger flick up                    | Read all from top of screen
2-finger flick down                  | Read all from current position
2-finger "scrub" (make a "z" shape)  | Dismiss / Go back
2-finger triple tap                  | Item Chooser
2-finger double-tap and hold         | Label Element
3-finger tap (e.g. list item number) | Speak additional information
3-finger double-tap                  | Toggle VoiceOver Speech on/off
3-finger triple-tap                  | Toggle Screen Curtain on/off
4-finger double tap                  | VoiceOver help

Notes:
* The 3-finger flick to move to the next/previous page also works in some apps, such as Stocks or Safari.
* When using VoiceOver and Zoom together, the 3-finger gestures change to include an additional tap. This is because the 3-finger double-tap is used by Zoom. The gesture for toggling VoiceOver Speech becomes a 3-finger triple-tap. The gesture for toggling Screen Curtain becomes a 3-finger quadruple-tap.


## Activate

Gesture                                           | Action
--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------
Double-tap                                        | Activate selected item
Double-tap and hold then perform standard gesture | Use "pass-thru" a standard gesture
Triple-tap                                        | Perform "Double-tap" on an item
2-finger double-tap                               | Perform "Magic tap"

Notes:
* The "pass-thru" gesture tells iOS to interpret the subsequent gesture as a standard gesture. For example, you can double-tap and hold for 1 second, then without lifting your finger, drag your finger to move a slider handle.
* A "Magic tap" is reserved for performs a primary action in an app or context, such as play/pause in Music, Videos, YouTube, Voice Memos, or Photos; take a photo in Camera; start/pause recording in Camera or Voice Memos; start/stop in Stopwatch.


## Rotor control

The Rotor mode can be adjusted using a dialling action on the screen, e.g. by placing the thumb and forefinger on the screen and moving the forefinger around the thumb in a circular motion.

Gesture                        | Action

Dial clockwise / anticlockwise | Cycle rotor category
Flick down                     | Find next item of category
Flick up                       | Find previous item of category


## Explore by touch

This is the mode of operation where one finger is held down on the screen and moved around. The item beneath the finger is announced by VoiceOver.

Gesture   | Action

Split-tap | Activate selected item

Notes:
* A split-tap is performed with a second finger when one finger is already held down on the screen. With an item selected, tap the screen with another finger to activate an item.
